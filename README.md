# Introduction

## Objective

In the process of getting ready for the B driver's license, it is possible to obtain a temporary license. The keeper must keep a logbook \(Journal de bord\) that tracks his or her route, traffic conditions and possible encountered difficulties. 

Today, the logbook has to be kept by printing and completing documents manually. The documents are provided on the site of [mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/en/node/547). There are two of them: an [overview of the rides](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/sites/default/files/apercu_des_trajets_-_overzicht_van_de_trajecten.pdf) and the [details of a rides](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/sites/default/files/details_par_trajet_-_details_per_traject.pdf). 

I was asked to hold a logbook myself. I can assure you that this is very demanding and takes a lot of time. This is why I find it useful to develop a mobile solution that automates \(as far as possible\) the the logbook.
