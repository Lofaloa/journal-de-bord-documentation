# Installation

## Prerequisites

The single-page application requires that two other services are up running:

* An instance of the Journal de bord RESTful API: this web service is used by the SPA to handle the users journal de bord resources. You can find its code in this [repository](https://github.com/Lofaloa/journal-de-bord-rest-api).
* An authorization server: this is the authority that secures the users resources. In my case, I have developed the project using an [instance of Keycloak embedded in a Spring Boot application](https://github.com/Lofaloa/journal-de-bord-authorization-server).

In the next section, you can find the required information that you need to provide to the SPA to make it work.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, the application is still in development and it is not integrated with the REST API.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

The application relies on multiple environment variables. They are described in the following subsection.

### Environment Variables

You need need to specify a value for each of the following variables in the `.env` file \(this file lives at the root of the project\).

* `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_URI`: is the root URI of the authorization server.
* `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`: is the identifier of this web client registered in your authorization server.
* `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_TOKEN_URI`: is the authorization server endpoint that provide this client with an access token.
* `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_LOGIN_URI`: is the authorization server endpoint that provide this client with a login page.
* `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_REGISTER_URI` : is the authorization server endpoint that provide this client with a register page.

{% hint style="info" %}
 The custom environment variables are set following the [React documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).
{% endhint %}

### How to configure

```text
# Clone or download the project
git clone https://github.com/Lofaloa/journal-de-bord-spa.git

# Be sure to set your working directory to the project root
cd journal-de-bord-spa

# .env.example is an existing template for the .env file. The variables are
# required for the project to run
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and set the variables values
vi .env
```

### Sample `.env` file

In the root of the project you can find the `.env.example`. The file is the one referred to in the previous subsection. Here is its content.

```bash
REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_URI=authServerUri
REACT_APP_RESOURCE_SERVER_URI=resourceServerUri
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=clientId
REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_LOGIN_URI=authServerLoginUri
REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_REGISTER_URI=authServerRegisterUri
```

## Deployment

This web client is published on Netlify. This section focuses on this platform. The configuration is easy. Netlify documentation explains how it is done right [here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables).

### Configuration

Netlify explains how to publish on this [tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/). Currently, the project is automatically deployed on Netlify when a branch is merged to the master. I still need to configure the environment variables manually.

To set the variables \(as described in the previous section\), go to:

1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Open the site to set the variables for
3. Go to Site _Settings_
4. Go to the _Build & Deploy_ section
5. Go to _Environment_

You should find this following screen. There you go üòÅ! Go ahead and set the required environment variables.
