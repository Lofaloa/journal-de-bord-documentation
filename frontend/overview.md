# Overview

## Introduction

The a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) is intended to provide a web client for the Journal de bord project. Currently, the project focuses on mobile users as the interface is optimized for smartphone users. I decided to implement the as an SPA so that the application can be used through a wide range of devices. Although the interface is mobile-first, it is still usable from a tablet or desktop computer.

The project source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Lofaloa/journal-de-bord-spa) and it \(should ðŸ˜…\) be up and running [here](https://journal-de-bord.netlify.app/).

## Technologies

The single-application was create using the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) utility. It is pretty interesting to understand the tool so that you know about the app configuration. You can read about it in its [official documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

The React components are developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
