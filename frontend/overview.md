# Overview

## Introduction

The a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) is intended to provide a web client for the Journal de bord project. Currently, the project focuses on mobile users as the interface is optimized for smartphone users. I decided to implement the as an SPA so that the application can be used through a wide range of devices. Although the interface is mobile-first, it is still usable from a tablet or desktop computer.

## Technologies
