# Development

## React router

**Note:** lors du déploiement d’une SPA sur Netlify il faut activer le routage du coté client comme suit : [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/\#netlify](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#netlify)

## Private routes

Some of the routes should be public, others should be protected \(available to authenticated users only\).

[Solution using react-router-dom](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43164554/how-to-implement-authenticated-routes-in-react-router-4) \(the same dude has written an [article](https://ui.dev/react-router-v4-protected-routes-authentication/)\).

The was created using creact-react-app and is using the typescript template following this [tutorial](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

The app is hosted on Netlify.

## Dependencies

* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-circular-progressbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-circular-progressbar) is used to render a custom progress bar in the home page.
